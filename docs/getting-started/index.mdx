This guide will walk you through setting up and building your first Claude Code-powered application. Whether you're creating an AI coding assistant, an embedded terminal, or a full IDE experience, you'll find everything you need to get up and running.

## What You'll Learn

By following this guide, you'll understand how to:

- Install and configure the `@dotdo/claude` SDK and `@dotdo/terminal` packages
